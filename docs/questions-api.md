## Question Explanation Feature

### üÜï Enhanced Learning with Single Explanations

The question system now supports a single detailed explanation per question that applies to the entire question context:

**For Admins:**
- ‚úÖ Can add one explanation when creating/editing questions
- ‚úÖ Can see explanations and correct answers for all questions
- ‚úÖ Can use explanations to provide comprehensive learning context

**For Students:**
- ‚ùå Explanations are hidden during normal viewing
- ‚úÖ Can be shown explanations in practice/quiz mode (frontend choice)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced learning when explanations are revealed after answering

### Explanation Structure

**New Structure (Question-level):**
- **Single explanation per question** that provides context for the entire question
- **Explains the concept** being tested, not individual answer choices
- **More educational approach** focusing on learning the underlying concept

**Benefits:**
- **Simplified content creation** - one explanation covers the whole question
- **Better learning focus** - explains the concept rather than individual choices
- **Cleaner data structure** - explanation tied to the question, not scattered across answers
- **More maintainable** - easier to update and manage explanations

### Example Usage Patterns

1. **Study Mode**: Show question explanation after student answers to provide learning context
2. **Quiz Mode**: Hide explanations until quiz completion, then show for learning reinforcement
3. **Review Mode**: Show all explanations to help students understand concepts
4. **Admin Preview**: Always show explanations for content quality review

### Content Guidelines

**Question Explanations should:**
- Explain the underlying concept being tested
- Provide educational context for the topic
- Help students understand the "why" behind the correct answer
- Be concise but comprehensive (max 1000 characters)
- Focus on learning rather than just correctness
